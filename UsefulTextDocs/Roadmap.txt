Workflows::
	
	Imported Workflows
		Include Ninja Flame & Gh4 & T1i (can workflows be camera/manufacturer/OS independent?)
		Buttons (activate, edit, delete w/undo)
	Import Wokflow
	Create Custom Workflow


Import::
	Select file (.txt?)

Create Custom Workflow::
	Single-Cam or Multi-Cam
	Sort files by (allow these paramaters to be drag-n-droped into a tree)
		Project Name
		Date, Month, Year
		Camera ID (only shown if Multi-Cam)
			Automatically advance sequentially or Manually identify cards when mounted
				if auto, choose structure (1 CAM, camera_A, etc)
				
		Card #
			Manually identify cards when mounted or use text file included on card
		Reel #
			automatically advance based on chosen structure (1 Reel, A, etc)
		Other metadata

Triggered upon drive insertion::

	Is this a source or target?
	Which camera is this? (only if Multi-Cam)


Preferences::

Every newly inserted drive vs. exceptions?
Windows staratup (Mac/Linux?)

More research::

Use ExifTool for extracting serial number
Copies of footage with different LUTs
Syncthing for syncing (command line, open source, MPL2.0???)
Unison (http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/)
Change Folder logos (http://codefromabove.com/2015/03/programmatically-adding-an-icon-to-a-folder-or-file/)
Black border around active item (Cadance highlights buttons that will be activated if return is pressed)
Add tiny text to buttons for keyboard shortcuts

create new def function

if 0 read progress
if 1 update progress+4

Start with 1 camera from 1 company
Things we need to figure out:
	Will cameras reformat all drives/partitions?

Abandoned Features::
	Manually ID camera on first card mount and then use that ID everytime a card is inserted with the same metadata. Problem: EXIF data is inconsistant. Try using ExifTool and/or MediaInfo.

	Copy (Everything, Specific File Types) Problem: liability for missreading/not copying data. Just copy everything
